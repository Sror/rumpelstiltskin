				<p><a class="dropcap_t2" href="">T</a>he king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not gold enough, and he had the miller's daughter taken into a still larger room full of straw, and said, <q>You must spin this, too, in the course of this night, but if you succeed, you shall be my wife.</q></p>

				<p>Even if she be a miller's daughter, thought he, I could not find a richer wife in the whole world.</p>

                <p>When the girl was alone the manikin came again for the third time, and said, <q>What will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time also?</q></p>

				<p><q>I have nothing left that I could give,</q> answered the girl.</p>

				<p><q>Then promise me, if you should become queen, to give me your first child.</q></p>

				<p>Who knows whether that will ever happen, thought the miller's daughter, and, not knowing how else to help herself in this strait, she promised the manikin what he wanted, and for that he once more spun the straw into gold.</p>
