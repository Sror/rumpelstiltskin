                <p>Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter.</p>
                <p>Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king, and in order to make himself appear important he said to him, "I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold."</p>
                <p>The king said to the miller, "That is an art which pleases me well, if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to-morrow to my palace, and I will put her to the test."</p>
