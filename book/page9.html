				<p><a class="dropcap_y" href="">Y</a>ou may imagine how glad the queen was when she heard the name. And when soon afterwards the little man came in, and asked, <q>Now, mistress queen, what is my name?</q></p>

				<p>At first she said, <q>Is your name Conrad?</q><br/>

				<q>No.</q><br/>

				<q>Is your name Harry?</q><br/>

				<q>No.</q><br/>

				<q>Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?</q></p>

				<p><q>The devil has told you that! The devil has told you that,</q> cried the little man, and in his anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went in, and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he tore himself in two.</p>
