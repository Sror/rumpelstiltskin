				<p><a class="dropcap_a" href="">A</a>nd when the king came in the morning, and found all as he had wished, he took her in marriage, and the pretty miller's daughter became a queen.</p>

				<p>A year after, she brought a beautiful child into the world, and she never gave a thought to the manikin. But suddenly he came into her room, and said, <q>Now give me what you promised.</q></p>

				<p>The queen was horror-struck, and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he would leave her the child. But the manikin said, <q>No, something alive is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world.</q></p>

				<p>Then the queen began to lament and cry, so that the manikin pitied her.</p>

				<p><q>I will give you three days, time,</q> said he, <a>if by that time you find out my name, then shall you keep your child.</a></p>
