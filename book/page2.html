				<p><a class="dropcap_a" >A</a>nd when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room which was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said, <q>Now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning early you have not spun this straw into gold during the night, you must die.</q></p>

				<p>Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone. So there sat the poor miller's daughter, and for the life of her could not tell what to do, she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and more frightened, until at last she began to weep.

				<p>But all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, and said, <q>Good evening, mistress miller, why are you crying so?</q></p>

				<p><q>Alas,</q> answered the girl, <q>I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not know how to do it.</q></p>

				<p><q>What will you give me,</q> said the manikin, <q>if I do it for you?</q></p>

				<p><q>My necklace,</q> said the girl.</p>
